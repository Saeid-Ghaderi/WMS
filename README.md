# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

This project implements a **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** focused on **stock allocation, order cancellation, and SKU quantity correction**, designed using **Clean Architecture**, **DDD principles**, and **SOLID** rules.

‚úÖ Stock Allocation for customer orders  
‚úÖ Priority-based and FIFO allocation  
‚úÖ Complete delivery validation  
‚úÖ Order cancellation (full or line item level)  
‚úÖ SKU quantity correction with substitute SKU reallocation  
‚úÖ Pagination for listing resources  
‚úÖ Clean separation of layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)

## üí° **Key Concepts**

### üîß **Domain Layer**
- **Entities**: CustomerOrder, LineItem, SKU, Location
- **Aggregates**: CustomerOrder as root for LineItems, SKU as root for stock quantities
- **Enums/Value Objects**: Priority, status handling within business logic

### üß© **Application Layer**
- Implements **Use Cases** as services:
  - CustomerOrderService
  - SkuService
  - SkuQuantityCorrectionService
  - OrderCancellationService

- Defines **Interfaces** for repositories to decouple infrastructure.

### üóÑ **Infrastructure Layer**
- Implements **Repositories** using EF Core:
  - CustomerOrderRepository
  - SkuRepository

- Contains **DbContext (ApplicationDbContext)** for database operations.

### üåê **API Layer**
- Exposes RESTful endpoints for:
  - Customer orders (CRUD, allocation)
  - SKU (CRUD, quantity correction)
  - Order cancellation (order and line item level)

## üìù **Use Case Example**

1. **Customer order is created.**
2. **Stock is allocated based on:**
   - Priority (High > Normal > Low)
   - FIFO for same priority
   - CompleteDeliveryRequired flag validation
3. **Order becomes ready to deliver.**
4. **If order or line item is cancelled, stock is released.**
5. **If SKU quantity is corrected and allocated stock is insufficient:**
   - Substitute SKU is searched.
   - If no substitute exists and CompleteDeliveryRequired is true, order is deallocated.
